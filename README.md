# Dhaaazen [PP]

+ **Category**: Personal Project
+ **Status**: Discontinued

## **Overview**

This is the first real project I ever worked on. This code is terribly written and outdated, but I like keeping this for memory.
This project will be archived and kept strictly for memory of my first ever project.
This is the starting point for everything I did discord related (especially EASE).  

Look at this code if you like, try to run it if you dare but don't judge me :')

## **Goal / Requirements**

This bot has for purpose to learn javascript and make something functional. It was created by taking inspiration of other small not well written bots.  
There is not much to add to that since there were no particular specification.

## **Technologies**

- Javascript
- Node.js
- [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris) library
